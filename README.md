## D3 Resources 

NPR's collection of D3 visualization templates. Not always great code, but well-tested and covers a range of responsive options. https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics-templates/  


[Aaron Williams](https://twitter.com/aboutaaron?lang=en) at [the Post](https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/lists/washington-post-people) has been posting about his workflow using D3 and Observable to prototype visualizations - https://twitter.com/aboutaaron/status/1107697344944975872

@observablehq is my go-to tool for quickly sketching ideas w/o a full dev setup. I was able to share sketches (privately!) and iterate as the story and designed evolved. Both graphics started as forks of a notebook I use for almost all my Observable work https://observablehq.com/@aboutaaron/setup-page
